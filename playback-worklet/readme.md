# Example of the Native-Worklet Protocol Implementation in TypeScript

The main implementation is in `index.ts`. Alongside it, we have 2 helper classes, `CircularBuffer` for buffering and `Lock` for a straightforward locking mechanism we can use while seeking.

The code is lovingly commented already, so please see the code for the comment regarding any aspects of my imlpementation.
